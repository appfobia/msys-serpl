Welcome to Tender Workflow Management System, SERPL Bhubaneswar
========================================================

Problems
------------

- Everyday materials department SERPL Bhubaneswar receive documents. Sometimes they are hard to track and the date of receival is also not maintained properly.
- Managing Tender floating/stages data becomes a problem while handling a number of tenders parallely.
- Often tracking of tender opening dates and important tender dates becomes quite hectic because a number of tenders are being processed simultaneously.
- No application is present for tracking the pending delivery of materials and the status of payment to vendors. 
- Data required for monthly and quarterly reports (Payment data, Work Awarded data) are generated manually by collecting data from SAP.

Project
------------

On the front-end,
- In/Out File Handling System
- Devendra's Calender
- Tender Workflow Management System
- Payment Management System

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
